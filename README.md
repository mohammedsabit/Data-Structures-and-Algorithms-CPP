# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

## 📌 Context
I am a Statistics graduate (B.Sc.) currently building a rigorous foundation in **Computer Science Fundamentals**. This repository documents my implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms using **C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. 

The focus is on writing efficient code with proper **Memory Management** (Heap vs. Stack), understanding **Time Complexity**, and utilizing standard containers effectively.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### ✅ Part 1: C++ Foundation & Memory Management
*   **00_Memory_Management_and_Pointers**
    *   Manual Memory Management (`new` / `delete`).
    *   Understanding Heap persistence vs. Stack allocation.
    *   Implementation of Dynamic Array Resizing.
*   **01_OOP_Concepts_and_Constructors**
    *   Class design and Object initialization.
    *   Dynamic Object creation for future Node implementation.
*   **02_Complex_Data_Handling**
    *   Handling Arrays of Objects.
    *   Implementing **Custom Comparators** for Sorting logic.
*   **03_Standard_Template_Library_String**
    *   String Tokenization using `stringstream` (NLP Foundation).
    *   Traversal using STL Iterators (`begin`, `end`).

### ✅ Part 2: Algorithmic Efficiency & Containers
*   **04_STL_Vector_and_Dynamic_Arrays**
    *   Implementation of dynamic arrays using STL Vector.
    *   Handling memory resizing, insertions, and modifiers.
*   **05_Searching_and_Optimization**
    *   **Binary Search:** Implementation of O(log N) search logic (Divide & Conquer).
    *   **Prefix Sum:** Optimization technique for O(1) Range Sum Queries.
